## Script

### Introduction (0:00 - 1:00)
**[Screen: Landing page of starter.gmac.io]**

"Hey everyone! Today I'm going to show you how to build a complete SaaS application in just 15 minutes using our production-ready starter kit.

By the end of this video, you'll have a fully functional SaaS with:
- User authentication
- Subscription payments
- A database
- Email notifications
- File uploads
- And analytics

Let's dive in!"

**[Transition to desktop/terminal]**

### Part 1: Getting Started (1:00 - 3:00)
**[Screen: Terminal]**

"First, let's clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/saas-starter.git
cd saas-starter
npm install
```

Now comes the magic - our setup wizard will configure everything automatically:

```bash
npm run setup:all
```

This single command will walk us through setting up all the services we need."

**[Screen: Setup wizard running]**

"The wizard is asking for our project name... I'll call this 'My Awesome SaaS'
Next, it wants our production URL... for now I'll use localhost
Now it's asking for our Clerk authentication keys..."

### Part 2: Authentication Setup (3:00 - 5:30)
**[Screen: Split screen - Clerk dashboard and terminal]**

"Let's quickly set up Clerk for authentication. I'll go to clerk.com and create a new application...

**[Clerk dashboard actions]**
- Create account
- Create new application
- Copy publishable key
- Copy secret key

Back in our terminal, I'll paste these keys when prompted.

The wizard is also asking about Stripe for payments..."

### Part 3: Payment Setup (5:30 - 8:00)
**[Screen: Split screen - Stripe dashboard and terminal]**

"For payments, I'll go to stripe.com and grab my API keys...

**[Stripe dashboard actions]**
- Navigate to API keys
- Copy publishable and secret keys
- Explain test vs live keys

Our wizard is smart - it can actually create Stripe products for us automatically! I'll say yes to that.

**[Screen: Terminal showing Stripe CLI setup]**

Look at that! It's creating our subscription products automatically:
- Starter plan at $19/month
- Professional at $49/month  
- Enterprise at $199/month

This would normally take 30 minutes to set up manually!"

### Part 4: Database Setup (8:00 - 9:30)
**[Screen: Turso dashboard and terminal]**

"For our database, we're using Turso - it's a lightning-fast SQLite database that runs at the edge.

**[Turso setup]**
- Show Turso dashboard
- Create database
- Copy credentials

The wizard is now configuring our database schema and seeding it with demo data. This includes sample users, API keys, and usage analytics."

### Part 5: Optional Services (9:30 - 11:00)
**[Screen: Various service dashboards]**

"The wizard is asking about optional services:

**Resend** for emails - I'll add this so we can send welcome emails
**Cloudinary** for file uploads - Great for user avatars and documents
**Sentry** for error tracking - Essential for production

I'm just pasting in the API keys as prompted..."

### Part 6: First Run (11:00 - 13:00)
**[Screen: Browser showing the application]**

"And we're done! Let's see what we built:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**[Browser walkthrough]**
- Home page with hero section
- Pricing page with our Stripe products
- Sign up flow with Clerk
- Dashboard with user profile
- Settings with API key management
- Billing page with Stripe customer portal

Let me test the payment flow... I'll use Stripe's test card 4242...
Perfect! I'm now subscribed to the Pro plan.

Let me check the admin features... I can see usage analytics, manage my subscription, and even upload files."

### Part 7: Production Deployment (13:00 - 14:30)
**[Screen: Vercel/deployment platform]**

"To deploy this to production, we have one-click deploy buttons for all major platforms.

I'll use Vercel - I just click the deploy button, connect my GitHub, add my environment variables, and deploy!

**[Show deployment process]**
- Connect GitHub
- Add environment variables  
- Deploy
- Show live site

In about 2 minutes, we have a live SaaS application!"

### Conclusion (14:30 - 15:00)
**[Screen: Final application]**

"And that's it! In just 15 minutes, we built and deployed a complete SaaS application with:

‚úÖ Authentication and user management
‚úÖ Subscription payments and billing
‚úÖ Database with real data
‚úÖ Email notifications
‚úÖ File uploads
‚úÖ Analytics and monitoring
‚úÖ API with rate limiting
‚úÖ Production deployment

The best part? This is all production-ready code that you can build upon.
