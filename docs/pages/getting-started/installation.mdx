# Installation

This guide will walk you through setting up the SaaS Starter Kit on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

## Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the starter kit repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clerk-stripe-starter
cd clerk-stripe-starter
```

## Install Dependencies

Install all required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install:
- Next.js and React
- Authentication libraries (Clerk)
- Payment processing (Stripe)
- Database clients (Turso, Drizzle)
- UI libraries (Tailwind CSS)
- And all other dependencies

## Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

You'll need to fill in your API keys and configuration. See the [Environment Variables](/getting-started/environment-variables) guide for details.

npm run db:push
```

This command will:
- Connect to your Turso database

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Dependencies not installing:**
```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force
# Delete node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Port already in use:**
```bash
# Run on a different port
